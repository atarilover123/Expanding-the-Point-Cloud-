### Expanding the point cloud: photogrammetry as sonic control

[Video presentation from Seeing Sound conference](https://vimeo.com/490464028) 

Step 1 - open "3dVisualiser" and "3dSonifier" patches.<br/>
Step 2 - initialise patches by turning on top left toggles and selecting a 3d shape in "3dVisualiser"<br/>
Step 3 - select 3d points to sonify using the rslider or randomised slider, move the sonification sliders to a desired selection of audio ("user pos") or select "3d pos" from the "playback mode" menu to have the 3d points mapped to audio.<br/>

<br/>

Step 4 - experiment. Try different 3d objects and sounds, different grain densities, pitches and methods of playback
