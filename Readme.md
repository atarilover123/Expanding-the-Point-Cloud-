Step 1 - open "3dVisualiser" and "3dSonifier" patches.
Step 2 - initialise patches by turning on top left toggles and selecting a 3d shape in "3dVisualiser" 
Step 3 - select 3d points to sonify using the rslider or randomised slider, move the sonification sliders to a desired selection of audio ("user pos") or select "3d pos" from the "playback mode" menu to have the 3d points maped to audio. 

Step 4 - experiment. Try different 3d objects and sounds, different grain densities, pitches and methods of playback
